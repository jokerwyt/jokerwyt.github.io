% 	abstract = {We introduce MudPad, a system capable of localized active haptic feedback on multitouch screens. We use an array of electromagnets combined with an overlay containing magnetorheological (MR) fluid to actuate a tablet-sized area. As MudPad has a very low reaction time it is able to produce instant multi-point feedback for multitouch input, ranging from static levels of surface softness to a broad set of dynamically changeable textures. Our system does not only convey global confirmative feedback on user input but allows the UI designer to enrich the entire interface with a tactile layer conveying local semantic information. This also allows users to explore the interface haptically.},

% 	abstract = {Textile interfaces are of interest to ubiquitous computing as they are easy to carry and manipulate. However, interesting questions remain about what type of natural gestures people make when interacting with textile interfaces and their emotional response to this interaction. We introduce GesFabri, a set of five interactive textile interfaces with distinct textures, created to investigate the intuitive interaction gestures and accompanied the emotional experience. This research sought to (1) design textile interfaces with intuitive gesture affordance, (2) explore the emotional effects of the developed gesture-based interfaces under four feedback modes (touch-only, visual feedback, audio feedback, multisensory feedback). The experimental results verify our hypotheses that (1) textile texture could provide natural gesture affordances; (2) the GesFabri interfaces' feedback mode was the main factor in the differences of emotional valence, arousal, GSR; and (3) both gesture-based interaction on textiles and the feedback mode had an impact on user emotions. These results highlight the gesture affordances of the e-textile interfaces and contribute to a better understanding of the user experience when interacting with gesture-based textile interfaces.},

% 	abstract = {In Internet of Things (IoT) era, electronic textiles (E-textiles), which combine various functional devices on a fabric, have attracted attention. Among various components for E-textiles, the human-machine interface device, for example, a keyboard, is one of the most important parts. The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) can be a powerful sensing component for the interface device due to its cost-eﬀectiveness, design ﬂexibility and selfpowered operation. Previous studies reported fabric-based sensor devices with TENG, but as yet, no device that harnesses commercial compatibility with the textile industry has been reported. It is timely to explore a low-cost TENG-based keyboard made completely of commercial fabric for early commercialization. This paper proposes a TENG-based wearable keyboard that uses only cheap commercial fabrics. Each cell in the proposed keyboard generates electrical signals according to an external touch without any power supply. After an appropriate ﬁltering process, the proposed keyboard can detect a key stroke without any ambiguity. We verify the keyboard operation by typing a word and playing music. The material dependency of the proposed keyboard is experimentally validated with various material pairs. Finally, the endurance of the proposed keyboard against folding, repeated touches and washing is experimentally conﬁrmed for actual applications in a real environment.},
