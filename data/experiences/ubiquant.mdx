I am fortunate to work alongside Zheng Cao, Zhongqi An, and other senior SDEs. 
We worked hard to build a high-performance RDMA library and a distributed in-memory cache for machine learning, which are deployed on hundreds of high-end GPU machines with eight GPUs each. I learned a lot from the industrial experience.
