I worked closely with [Jianyu](https://kaleid-liner.github.io/about/more/) under the guidance of [Ting Cao](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ticao/).
I contributed some preliminary results to *[ISCA'2024 Pre-gated MoE: An Algorithm-System Co-Design for Fast and Scalable Mixture-of-Expert Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12066)*.
But unfortunately, my work is completed at a relatively early stage of this project, which was not sufficient to earn authorship.
