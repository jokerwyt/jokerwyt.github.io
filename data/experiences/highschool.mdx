During high school, I focused extensively on Olympiads in Informatics (OI), which brings me a very good understanding in **algorithms and data structures**. I won a silver medal in Chinese National Olympics in Informatics Competition (NOI 2020), and several ICPC regions and semi-final gold medals during my bachelor time.
